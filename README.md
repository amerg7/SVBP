## About The Project
The project is a smart eyeglass named “Smart Vision for Blind People” (SVBP) for people with complete or partial
blindness by giving them information about their surrounding environment including the people by using face/object
detection and recognition and obstacle avoidance. The SVBP system will output voice-based guidance to guide the person
through his/her path and read the environment using a camera that takes inputs from the environment and its contents,
calculate the distance between the camera’s location and all near objects, based on that calculation, SVBP will give
information about all objects such as names, distance, and in case of a living object, it will give the name of the
person, an approximate distance separating the user from the person, an approximate indication of the user’s facial
expression. All this information generated from SVBP will have a form of physical output which is through the use of
headphones/speakers.
